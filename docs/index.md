WWIV BBS SOFTWARE has a long [history](history.md), this project is to give WWIV a strong future.

Were working hard to bring you the best bbs software we can. This wiki is to support the users of WWIV from install to customization.

Thank you,  
The WWIV Dev Team

## New Installations
The following steps will get you up and running quickly, but I would not say
you're ready to go live and open up to users. After you complete these installation 
steps, see the full details on related INIT settings, WWIV.INI and other Advanced 
configuration topics.

Do you have your floppy disks with your 4.x WWIV BBS on it? We can get you upgraded to WWIV
and you can join the fold again!

## [Init Settings](init.md)
## User Access Protocols for WWIV
BBSes used to only be accessible by dialing them up on your phone line with a MODEM. When 
the Internet took off many BBSes added Telnet support to allow users to connect to the BBS
over the Internet. That is still in use today. These pages explain how to use the WWIV 
builtin Telnet Server and Net2BBS from PCMicro.

The email system in WWIV allows the sending of email to other users on the system as well as other users in WWIV based networks you participate in and even to Internet users if you have the appropriate add on software installed. Sending email is as easy as hitting the E key at the WFC or online.  You can email a local user by name or number.  For sending WWIV based network mail, see the network documentation for addressing. 

TODO: How his Internet mail handling with the new tools?
